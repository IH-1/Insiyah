    Understanding the 'Human-Self' - Research into human psychology 

In 2012, a study from Harvard found that "sharing personal information on social media taps into the "reward" center of our brain, triggering the same part that's tapped into when taking an addictive substance (Mercado, 2020)"

A study published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence mentiones the two approaches to like culture (Lee, 2014). 
| Reaction / Response | Function / Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| People Like / Favorite / Save based on a 'reaction response'  liking a celebrities, family or friends post | People Like / Favorite / Save for a goal, a purpose, to learn something or to agree with something |

In 2019, a study out of Michigan State University found that "social media use may negatively impact our decision making. Specifically, it seemed to correlate with an inability to make good decisions in high-risk situations (Mercado, 2020)" 

  



     The Goal

Use the Arduino input system to help the global social media community understand the mechanics behind our social media likes.
Reminding the community why it's necessary to take a step back from scrolling every so often
- 
**Concept** is based on pushing a lever to gain a reward but not in a predictable way. Sometimes you gain something , sometimes you don't but every once in a while it is a great treat. 
- 
+ Exposing the system by a system 
+ The outcome will be open-source / available to all 


    
      The Build 
      
  *The process of creation and testing is still in progress.
  
  Here are some images from the tests - 
    

   
    
    
    
      Be apart of this consciousness movement !
     
   - [ ] Use / share our open-source as a means of education 
   - [ ] Try and Limit your scrolling time
   - [ ] Switch of unnecessary notifications
   - [ ] Switch on your human intelligence and govern your choices

 


Please, scroll with care üòä
