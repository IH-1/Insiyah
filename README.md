    Understanding the 'Human-Self' - Research into human psychology 

In 2012, a study from Harvard found that "sharing personal information on social media taps into the "reward" center of our brain, triggering the same part that's tapped into when taking an addictive substance (Mercado, 2020)"

A study published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence mentiones the two approaches to like culture (Lee, 2014). 
| Reaction / Response | Function / Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| People Like / Favorite / Save based on a 'reaction response'  liking a celebrities, family or friends post | People Like / Favorite / Save for a goal, a purpose, to learn something or to agree with something |

In 2019, a study out of Michigan State University found that "social media use may negatively impact our decision making. Specifically, it seemed to correlate with an inability to make good decisions in high-risk situations (Mercado, 2020)" 

Why is social Media so attractive?


Look at this example: "So, you have a rat pushing a lever and he gets rewarded, but not in a predictable way. Many times, that animal pushes that lever and nothing comes, but every once in a while, it gets a great treat. So the rat keeps pressing and pressing and pressing even though there's not much reinforcement coming because every once in a while, it's just great (Lee, 2014)" 
This example is similar to our use of social media, we get a notification close the app get another notification we are back on the app, constantly in search for that positive reinforcement. 

     The Goal

Use learnings from Arduino an Processing systems to help the global community understand the mechanics behind our social media likes.
Reminding the community why it's necessary to take a step back from scrolling every so often. 
- 
Concept based on pushing a lever to gain a reward but not in a predictable way. Sometimes you gain something , sometimes you don't but every once in a while it is a great treat. 

+ Exposing the system by a system 
+ The outcome will be open-source / available to all 
   + Creating a sense of community through our common struggles of excessive screen time 
   + Actulizing the social media scrolling culture through an exaggerated approach 
   + Using data collection through Arduino / generative art to draw conclusions & raise awareness 

  
         The Build 
      
  *The process of creation and testing is still in progress.
  
  Here are some images from the tests -
