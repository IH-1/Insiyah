    Understanding the 'Human-Self' - Research into human psychology 

In 2012, a study from Harvard found that "sharing personal information on social media taps into the "reward" center of our brain, triggering the same part that's tapped into when taking an addictive substance (Mercado, 2020)"

A study published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence mentiones the two approaches to like culture (Lee, 2014). 
| Reaction / Response | Function / Purpose |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| People Like / Favorite / Save based on a 'reaction response'  liking a celebrities, family or friends post | People Like / Favorite / Save for a goal, a purpose, to learn something or to agree with something |

In 2019, a study out of Michigan State University found that "social media use may negatively impact our decision making. Specifically, it seemed to correlate with an inability to make good decisions in high-risk situations (Mercado, 2020)" 

     The Goal

Use learnings from Arduino an Processing systems to help the global community understand the mechanics behind our social media likes.
Reminding the community why it's necessary to take a step back from scrolling every so often. 
- 
Concept based on pushing a lever to gain a reward but not in a predictable way. Sometimes you gain something , sometimes you don't but every once in a while it is a great treat. 
- 
+ Exposing the system by a system 
+ The outcome will be open-source / available to all 
   + Creating a sense of community through our common struggles of excessive screen time 
   + Actulizing the social media scrolling culture through an exaggerated approach 
   + Using data collection through Arduino / generative art to draw conclusions & raise awareness 

  
         The Build 
      
  *The process of creation and testing is still in progress.
  
  Here are some images from the tests using Ardurino and Processing to create Generative Art -

    Processing - Generative Art Test 
    
   **How it works**
Every time a person clicks a button on their keyboard it triggers the system to create a new outcome. The outcome is never the same, each time it is a completely new variation. Furthermore, depending on the method of triggering a response the outcome varies. For example if one were to hold the key down the outcome would result in a flashing cycle (the keys are sensitive and hence the speed of the outcome would depend on the pressure you press the key with)

     Comcluding Thought : 

Using Arduino, Markdown and Processing has given me the opportunity to re-examine the impulsive nature of todays societies. Impulsive decisions and fast past living has its benefits however sometimes it is important to notice the little spaces or signs that life has to offer. We need to learn the 'codeâ€™ of a healthy balanced life to produce an output that has least error.
